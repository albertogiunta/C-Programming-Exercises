C-Programming-Exercises
=======================

The complete set of C programming exercises (from october to december 2013) of the C Programming Course at Computer Science and Engineering University (Cesena - University of Bologna).

Unfortunately they are all written and commented in Italian (I'm sorry but at this time I've no time to translate them all).
